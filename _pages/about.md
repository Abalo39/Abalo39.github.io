I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an M.Sc. in **Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**, South Africa. My mission is to bridge the gap between complex mathematical theory and impactful real-world applications.

### Research Focus

My research lies in developing robust machine learning methodologies, with a particular interest in deep learning architectures that can handle noisy, real-world data. My recent work includes:

* **Novel Loss Functions**: Developed a Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss function to enhance the robustness of neural networks.
* **Epidemiological Modeling**: Applied robust LSTM models to predict malaria incidence using a 10-year public health dataset (2013–2023).
* **Robust Forecasting**: Investigating time series methodologies that maintain high accuracy despite outliers and data contamination.
