# Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA

I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**, South Africa. My research focus lies in robust machine learning, particularly deep learning methodologies for time series forecasting.

Previously, I completed a Joint M.Sc. in Mathematics at **PAUSTI, Kenya**, in collaboration with Jomo Kenyatta University, where I developed a hybrid Minkowski-Log-Cosh loss function for robust LSTM models.

## Research Interests
* **Robust Machine Learning:** Developing loss functions for outlier-contaminated data.
* **Time Series Forecasting:** Applying deep learning to epidemiological data.
* **NLP & Large Language Models:** Exploring the frontiers of modern AI.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Making complex models interpretable.
