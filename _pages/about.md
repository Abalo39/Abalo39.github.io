I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an M.Sc. in **Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**, South Africa. My mission is to bridge the gap between complex mathematical theory and impactful real-world applications.

### Research Focus

My research lies in developing robust machine learning methodologies, with a particular interest in deep learning architectures that can handle noisy, real-world data. My recent work includes:

* **Novel Loss Functions**: Developed a Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss function to enhance the robustness of neural networks.
* **Epidemiological Modeling**: Applied robust LSTM models to predict malaria incidence using a 10-year public health dataset (2013–2023).
* **Robust Forecasting**: Investigating time series methodologies that maintain high accuracy despite outliers and data contamination.

### Academic Journey

**M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa — 2023 – Present  

**Joint M.Sc. in Mathematics (Statistics Option)** Pan African University (PAUSTI), Kenya — 2021 – 2023  

**B.Sc. in Mathematics & Statistics** Université de Kara, Togo — 2018 – 2021  

### Technical Expertise

* **Programming**: Python (Advanced), R, MATLAB, SQL, C/C++
* **Machine Learning**: LSTM Networks, Deep Learning, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
* **Tools & Analysis**: Power BI, STATA, LaTeX, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

### Leadership & Teaching

**Tutor (Volunteer)** — Ecole Polytechnique de Lomé  
Instructed Master’s students in Inferential Statistics and Optimization techniques (KKT Conditions, Gradient methods).

**Mathematics and Physics Teacher** — High School, Togo  
Delivered curriculum in Physics and Probability for four years.
