I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an M.Sc. in **Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**, South Africa. My research focus lies in developing robust machine learning methodologies, with a particular interest in time series forecasting and deep learning architectures that can handle noisy, real-world data.

## Research Focus
My recent work involves the development of a **Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss function**. This novel approach enhances the robustness of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, which I have applied to predict malaria incidence using a 10-year dataset from 2013 to 2023.



## Academic Journey
* **M.Sc. in AI for Science** | AIMS South Africa | *2025 – Present*
* **Joint M.Sc. in Mathematics (Statistics)** | PAUSTI, Kenya | *2023 – 2025*
* **B.Sc. in Mathematics & Statistics** | Université de Kara, Togo | *2018 – 2021*

## Technical Expertise
* **Programming**: Python (Advanced), R, MATLAB, SQL
* **Machine Learning**: LSTM Networks, Deep Learning, Feature Engineering
* **Tools**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Power BI, LaTeX, GitHub

## Leadership & Teaching
I am committed to academic mentorship, having served as a **Mathematics and Physics teacher** for four years in Togo and a volunteer tutor for Master’s students in **Big Data**, specializing in inferential statistics and optimization.
